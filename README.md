# Woofie App üêæ

Ruby on Rails social media project specifically for dog lovers üêï

## Introduction

Most popular social media caters a wide variety of people with different interests, making it a jack of all trades. That's why we created a social media that targets a specific market (and of course, dog lovers!). So going in to this app, you don‚Äôt have to guess anymore, because you know that they have the same interest as you. ‚ò∫

## Description

Our app is as much as what you expected from a social media. You can create an account, chat with people, add new friends and share your thoughts through posting and commenting.... so why use this app?

***DOGS***

If that's not a reason enough, here's more:

- [x] customize your dashboard based on your preferred dogs.
- [x] join a dog community to see posts and comments specifically for that dog breed.
- [x] see what other users prefer or checkout out all of the people joined in a specific community.
- [x] toxic free contents! who loves dogs and are toxic anyway? üòÑ
- [ ] no dancing guys/gals here.....
- [x] .....but expect to see dancing dogs!

## Requirements

* ruby 3.1.2
* rails 7.0.3.1
* redis
* postgresql

#### API used:
- The Dog API (for the sample of dog lists)
- randomuser (for the avatar randomizer of dummy accounts)

most gems are plug-n-play, just run `bundle install` and you're good to go!

## Startup

- Run `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed` to create the database
- Go to the page and create an account.
- Upon registering, it will email you the confirmation link to proceed in logging in.

... and that's it!

#### Running the `rails db:seed` earlier will generate the following:
- Sample dog lists as basis for the dog community.
- Channels (group chat) for the created dog community.
- Dummy accounts. You may use "dummy01@email.com" as username (up to "dummy10@email.com") with all having the same password as "123456"
